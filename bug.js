This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This commonly happens when you use functional components with useState and try to access the state variable within the component's render method before the component has mounted.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes. 

Example:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  //Incorrect: Accessing count before it's initialized
  console.log('Initial count:', count); 

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
